          Meditation and Mindfulness. I have read quite a bit of Search Inside Yourself, and recognise the importance of taking time to meditate and practice mindfulness. I have tried quite a few times, but have yet to form this into a habit. I have subscribed to the Headspace App so will see how that goes, and I've also plotted out a schedule with regular times for meditation and exercise.

          Growth and Fixed Mindset. I have read a lot about this in the past and know Carol Dweck's work quite well. I try to maintain a growth mindset and think in general I am that way inclined. I like to think I won't die wondering.

          Pomodoro Technique. I used this when studying for my Masters and found it a great way of knocking out chunks of work in quick succession. I haven't quite got into the rhythm yet, but will work on this technique over the next 19 weeks.

          I'm keen to learn more about the Fogg Method.
