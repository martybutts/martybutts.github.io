    <h1>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
    <h2>Thoughts on the EDA experience</h2>
    <h3>22 May 2016</h3>
    
    <p>
      My take: Coming from an education background a lot of the philosophy of the programme seems very familiar. The approach is very future-focused and aims to prepare students as life-long learners. The aim seems to be for each person to develop learning habits that are best suited to them personally. Other contemporary approaches to learning that Shereef mentions are an emphasis on student-centric and collaborative learning, the idea of fast failure and the ability to communicate clearly and confidently. Also time-management using the pomodoro technique.

      My impressions: I like some of the analogies he uses. He compares learning to code with learning to play the guitar. First, learning finger positions, strumming techniques, chord structures and melodies, with the end goal being able to compose a song. I really like the analogy of architecture and pointing out that the aspiration is not to become a bricklayer (eg: knowing javascript really well), but to understand the essence of architecture and to develop an engineering sense, knowledge of principals.

      How I see myself engaging with this type of culture?: I have made sure I can give the course my full attention, which I think is needed. One thing I think I need to work on is to identify the balance between trying to work things out for myself and asking for help.

    <p>
      Have my expectations changed?: No I don't think so. I have a friend doing the bootcamp at the moment, so I have had a bit of insight into what to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I excited? Nervous?: Yes, and yes! Excited, because I love learning new things, and am keen on making a career change in this direction. Nervous, because I don't have any real background in IT and there is so much to learn.
