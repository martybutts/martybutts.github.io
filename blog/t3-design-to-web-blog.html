				<h3>
					What is responsive web design, and why is responsiveness inportant?
				</h3>
				<p>Responsive web design makes web pages look good on any device, including desktop, tablets and mobile phones. It does this through code that tells the content to resize, reposition, hide, or move according to the size of the screen. Responsive design has become more important as the variety of screen sshapes and sizes has increased. Responsiveness ultimately allows for a better user experience and acknowledges that user requirements may be different depending on which device they are using.</p>
				<h3>
					What is mobile first design, and why is it important?
				</h3>
				<p>Mobile first design follows the idea of progressive enhancement. This means beginning by tailoring content to a mobile phone, and then building on that by adding responsiveness for larger screen sizes. This might mean rearranging the content as screen size increases, or possibly adding different content. The mobile first approach has become important because mobile internet usage is on the increase, and this approach allows developers to focus on core functionality on a smaller screen.</p>
				<h3>
					What is a wireframe, and why do we use them?
				</h3>
				<p>A wireframe is a visual representation, or blueprint, of the basic layout and structure of a website. We use them as a starting point when mapping out the basic design of a site. They allow us to consider the purpose of the website, establish a hierarchy of elements, and think about how to best arrange these elements to best accomplish the site's purpose.</p>

				<h3>
					Aspects of my wireframe I found difficult.
				</h3>
				<p>I found it hard to visualise how elements might rearrange or change as screen size increases. In particular I found it hard to work out how these changes might happen. I imagine this is something that comes with experience!</p>
