					Explain the following terms to a non-tech friend:
				</h3>
				<h3>parentheses ():</h3>
				<p>These are used to contain expressions and parameters. They are particularly used to contain one or more parameteres when declaring a function. They are also used in other instances where a series of actions need to be contained. A good example is the 'for' loop.</p>
				<h3>brackets []:</h3>
				<p>These are used when declaring the contents of an array, and when calling arrays.</p>
				<h3>braces {}:</h3>
				<p>These are used to contain the contents of a function, and are also used to wrap around objects.</p>
				<h3>single quotes '' and double quotes "":</h3>
				<p>These are interchangeable and are used to surround string characters. Once you have used one or the other it is important to then continue using the same.</p>
