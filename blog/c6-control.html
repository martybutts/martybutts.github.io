				<h3>
					What learnings did you take from this chapter?
				</h3>
				<p>There is quite a lot of content covered in this chapter. I guess the important bits for me were the importance of choice over compulsion, the idea of choosing not to feed the monsters, and the references yet again to the importance of focusing on your breathing (the pause).</p>
				<h3>
					How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
				</h3>
				<p>I've been doing one of the meditations on the Headspace website each day. These are 10 minutes and combine several of the practices covered in SIY, particularly the body scan that we looked at last week. I find them really useful because it is guided meditation and this help me to flex that attention muscle, bringing attention back when the mind strays. It always seems a lot longer than just 10 minutes, which I guess is a sign that I am slowing right down, and I always feel calmer and more focused afterwards.</p>
