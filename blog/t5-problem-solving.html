				<h2 class="content-header">Problem Solving</h2>
				<h3>
					A time when I got blocked on a simple problem.
				</h3>
				<p>I thought I was doing a good thing when I downloaded 'Eloquent JS' as a pdf. I had the entire book rather than just the online chapter that was linked to in the instructions. When it came to the tasks at the end of the chapter however, I got really stuck because the pdf didn't have the same interactive content as the online chapter. The online chapter had a space to paste and check your code, whereas the pdf didn't. I became quite confused and overcompicated the problem trying to work out ways to test my code. Techniques I used were to try something, Googling and asking my peers for help. Of course, the final technique produced an immediate result. On reflection, this was something very straightforward that I didn't even consider when problem solving myself. Re-thinking the task from the very beginning would have been beneficial.</p>
				<h3>
					A time when I solved a problem in an eloquent way.
				</h3>
				<p>I was working on one of the more complicated JavaScript exercises and the logic was overwhelming me. I had tried posting on slack and received some good tips, but I still couldn't resolve the problem. I decided to pseudocode the logic, and found that this was a great technique for this type of problem. The code itself was confusing me, but writing it out in step by step sentences helped to give a lot more clarity. Having gone through this process, and then revisited the tips on Slack, I was able to resolve the problem and I also learned how to better understand the code.</p>
				<h3>
					Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
				</h3>
				<p>Psuedocode - This was the big one for me this week. As a visual learner it seems to help me visualise the code more clearly.
				Try something - I'm working on this one, but often feel like I'm shooting in the dark.
				Rubber ducky method - I still need to work on this one.
				Reading error messages - likewise, this is a technique I have yet to explore.
				Console.logging - I am keen to set up Node so that I can explore this technque further. It sort of fits with the 'try something' method.
				Googling - This sometimes works well for me, and other times I find I can spend hours wading through stuff trying to find what I'm looking for. I guess if it's not something you can find fairly quickly, then it's time to try a different technique.
				Asking peers for help - I'm getting better at determining when to do this, as I don't think it should be the default.
				Asking coaches for help - I use this for those nagging questions that aren't necessarily urgent. Each week I write these down to discuss during our one-one time.
				Improving your process with reflection - I try to keep in mind how I learn best and to turn to those techniques more and more.

				<h3>
					Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:
				</h3>
				<p>.map() - This function makes a new array of results from each element having a function run over each item in the original array.
				.filter() - This function makes a new array of just the filtered items, named as the filter.
				.reduce()This function reduces arrays to single numbers, or flattens nested arrays, with the use of a reducer and a function. This reducer runs the function across the array, calling over the array until the single result is achieved.
