				<h3>
					How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
				</h3>
				<p>I've tried to keep the concept for this week (play) in the forefront of my mind. I am aware that life as a developer is going to be littered with periods where things just aren't working and I don't know why, or how to fix them. By continually trying to play around with the code and try things out I will become more familiar with it and hopefully become better at solving problems. Currently the problems are many and diverse, and progress is slow. Looking forward to arriving at that happy place where things become a bit more intuitive.</p>
				<h3>
					What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
				</h3>
				<p>I have skipped ahead and have read quite a bit of the book. I guess before reading this book I thought of meditation as a process of emptying out your mind to achieve a state of calm nothingness.</p>
				<h3>
					What new things have you learnt about meditation?
				</h3>
				<p>The main thing I have got from this book is the idea that in fact you don't try to block things out. Instead you focus on acknowledging passing thoughts, but not giving them too much attention, letting them come and go. I also like the idea that you are exercising a muscle by constantly bringing your attention back to the meditation.</p>
				<h3>
					Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
				</h3>
				<p>I've been using the 'Headspace' app, which guides you through a 10 minute meditation each day. I have found these quite useful in traing you to practice two types of meditation, looking outwards and then inwards.</p>
