				<h3>
					Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical?
				</h3>
				<p>I'm not sure if this is right, but maybe we can think of it as a meal. HTML is the recipe, the DOM is the actual meal you have cooked, and CSS is the seasoning.</p>
				<h3>
					What is meant by boxifying design?
				</h3>
				<p>Boxiying design is an approach to web page design where all of the elements are first considered as being compartmentalised into boxes. This adds a sense of logic to the organisation of the page, and also allows you to redesign the page more easily by moving around the boxes.</p>
				<h3>
					What is the box model?
				</h3>
				<p>This is ther term we use when talking about the design and layout of web pages. If we think about each html element having a box wrapped around it, this can help when considering editing the page. Each box contains margins, borders and padding around the actual content, all of which can be adjusted.</p>
