				<h3>
					What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
				</h3>
				<p>I'm afraid I wasn't organised enough this week to sit down with someone, so I'll save my comments until that happens.</p>
				<h3>
					Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
				</h3>
				<p>Mindful listening is obviously the big one that I can see having long term benefits, but I am also keen to practice mindful walking. I actually find it really hard to maintain a focus during this activity, so it is a good one in terms of flexing that mindfulness muscle.</p>
				<h3>
					Any other musings?
				</h3>
				<p>I have continued using the meditations on Headspace. These are only 10 minutes, but it seems like time slows when I am doing them and I enter a more relaxed and focused state. A very worthwhile 10 minutes.</p>
