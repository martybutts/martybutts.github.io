				<h3>
					Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?
				</h3>
				<p>In my role as a middle manager I hope that I practised a lot of what is covered in this chapter. This position in any organisation is one that requires good communication and empathy. Putting yourself in another person's shoes and the ability to listen empathetically, I think are the two most important attributes of an effective manager. I have often presented collective ideas to senior management, and I would not have been able to do so with sincerity had I not first gained an empathetic undrstanding of people's perspectives. It is always a rewarding experience to listen to another person as they open up their thoughts and feelings to you.</p>
				<h3>
					Try empathic listening - how did it go?
				</h3>
				<p>I consciously thought about these strategies while I talked to a friend on the phone. It occured to me that we are genuinely open with eachother and have no trouble putting ourselves in each other's shoes to offer feedback on our well being. So I'd say that a lot of these strategies happen naturally between good friends, although the language provided in the book makes these conversations more explicit.</p>
				<h3>
					How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
				</h3>
				<p>I enjoyed it. As with all of the meditation exercises I appreciated the opportunity to practice. Meng wants to achieve world peace. I want to encourage all young people to view the future with optimism, as full of opportunity and great, amazing things. There is a lot in the press about how how human beings have ruined the world and the end is coming. That's way too big a burden for them to carry. Wishing them happiness is a good first step.</p>
				<h3>
					Any other musings?
				</h3>
				<p>The book is well put together in that every subsequent chapter can be brought back to the process of mindfulness in meditation, bringing your focus inward through a focus on breathing, and then outward through a non-judgemental attitude to the world around you.</p>
