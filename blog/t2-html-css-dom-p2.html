				<h3>
					What is grid based design?
				</h3>
				<p>Grid based web design is a particular approach to organising elements on a webpage. The example used is a grid of 12 columns. Elements are then organised in rows across the 12 columns. A row might consist of two elements that span, for example, 9 and 3 columns respectively.</p>
				<h3>
					What's all the hype about responsive webpages?
				</h3>
				<p>With the range of devices and screen sizes currently available, it is important for webpages to be able to adapt to different shapes and sizes. Responsive design allows this to happen, because content is not fixed to a specific size and responds to the particular screen on which it is being viewed.</p>
				<h3>
					What is semantic structure?
				</h3>
				<p>Semantic structure is all about allocating html tags in a logical or sensible way to the content. For example, headings 1, 2 and 3 should indicate the relative importance of each heading, or grouping of text.</p>
