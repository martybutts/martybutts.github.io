				<h3>
					How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?
				</h3>
				<p>I think part of why I'm on this course is to do with the idea of higher purpose. In my previous role as an educator the greatest satisfaction I felt was through having a direct and positive influence on individual students, building a bond and working with that person to find/build their path in the world. I also experienced the impact of new technologies on that process of decision making, and my voluntary involvement and interest in this area has led me to this course. Working with technology at this point in time has the potential to make a positive impact on the greater good for all.</p>
				<p>I agree with the author that it is important to align everyday life with higher purpose. The times that I have most experienced flow and mastery have been during solitary activities, particularly making artworks, writing and playing music. These are creative, hands on activities that it is easy to lose yourself in. I am looking forward to experiencing flow in web development soon.</p>
				<p>Pleasure is the most fleeting of the three. It might be experienced in hearingthe applause at the end of the song, sitting back to look at the painting you've just completed, or when you finally crack the code for that minesweeper game.</p>
				<h3>
					From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values?
				</h3>
				<p>Elegance, Empathy, Family-orientedness, Curiosity, Self-actualisation, Creativity.</p>
				<h3>
					What do you stand for?
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Healthy, happy children.</li>
					<li>Integrity, being true to yourself.</li>
					<li>Positive and optomistic attitude.</li>
					<li>Being dependable and trustworthy.</li>
					<li>Being flexible and adaptable to change.</li>
					<li>To inspire people with beautiful things.</li>
					<li>Going the extra mile.</li>
				</ul>>
				<h3>
					How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
				</h3>
				<p>Cognitive resilience is built on an optomistic attitude and an ability to overcome setbacks, all of which I have experienced during this course. During the meditation exercises I found it difficult to achieve the states of mind that were suggested, but I could see the intention.</p>
				<h3>
					Any other musings?
				</h3>
				<p>A lot of this chapter was to do with being well grounded in your own beliefs and your own sense of being. It was/is worthwhile to step back and review these things.</p>
