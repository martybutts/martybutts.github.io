					What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
				</h3>
				<p>They both aim to achieve the same thing. Mindfulness is a trained ability to focus attention, and in doing so bringing a calm restfulness and at once a degree of connection, but also detachment from your thoughts, emotions and environment. Self awareness is all about being conscious of, and being able to control, your thoughts and emotions, even in very stressful environments. Both lead towards increased emotional intelligence.</p>
				<h3>
					Try at least one of the self awareness practices. What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
				</h3>
				<p>I have been doing regular meditations similar to the body scan, so I tried this one. I think it's great how the simple act of sitting and focusing can have such a calming effect on your body. The aches and pains disipated noticeably with the focus on positive emotion.</p>
				<h3>
					What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
				</h3>
				<p>This part reminded me of my belief as a teacher that you always address the behavior and not the child. Current research about achievement also supports this point of view. The author suggests that an increased self awareness allows us to gain perspective on our behavior and emotions, and that has to be a good thing.</p>
