				<h3>
					How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
				</h3>
				<p>HTML provides the content of the website and CSS adds a particular look, or style to that content. To go further than this, to make a website interactive for the user, we use JavaScript. The main uses of JavaScript are to make websites respond to user interaction; to build apps and games; to access information on the internet (eg. the top trending words on Twitter by topic); to organise and present data (data visualisation, automated spreadsheet work)</p>
				<h3>
					Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.
				</h3>
				<p>Control flow is the order or sequence in which actions are completed. The chunks of code used to determine the correct order are called loops. When you’re getting dressed in the morning you no doubt have strategies in place to make sure your underpants go on before your trousers, your socks before your shoes, and so on. In the same way, control flow ensures that when code is called it is processed in the correct order.</p>
				<h3>
					Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.
				</h3>
				<p>We access data from arrays using bracket notation, whereas we can access data from object literals using either bracket notation or dot notation.</p>
				<h3>
					Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
				</h3>
				<p>Functions are blocks of code that will complete the same task over and over. They Perform their action when we “call” them. They are useful because we can give them different parameters, like cooking the same meal, but using different ingredients.</p>
